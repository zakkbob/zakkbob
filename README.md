## Hi there 👋 I'm zakk

- 🔭 Currently working on my homelab, or 5 random projects which I'll probably never finish
- 🌱 Also learning how to use Arch _(btw)_
- 📫 Reach me at [me\@zakkbob.dev](mailto:me\@zakkbob.dev)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an awesome github account [@zakkbob](https://github.zakkbob.dev) (you're on it right now)
- 💥 Funner fact: I own [zakkbob.dev](https://zakkbob.dev), which may or may not someday feature a website

I also made a GPG key for some reason. So here's its fingerprint: <br>
```98B4 BC6E 8CCE DB80 0D5C C9CD A4D5 6AE3 1822 7B60```

Also, feel free to add this to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPImXXXefC5tQbzAHvcmvwswXgUaYPPdkgzH+2v7QnN4```

Random stats nobody looks at <br>
