## Hi there 👋 I'm zakkbob

- 🔭 Currently working on my homelab, or 5 random projects which I'll probably never finish
- 🌱 Also learning how to use Arch _(btw)_
- 📫 Reach me at [me\@zakkbob.dev](mailto:me\@zakkbob.dev)
- 🐠 Pronouns: fish/bob
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an awesome github account [@zakkbob](https://github.zakkbob.dev) (you're on it right now)
- 💥 Funner fact: I own [zakkbob.dev](https://zakkbob.dev), which may or may not someday feature a website
- 💃 Funnest fact: I recently joined [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (its amazing, if you're under 18, you should join too!)

I also made a GPG key for some reason. So here's its fingerprint: <br>
```F5F0 C5CD 7E01 B582 DA9C BA07 7109 3420 23C3 40E3```
