## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm zakkbob

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on my homelab, or 5 random projects which I'll probably never finish
- ðŸŒ± Also learning how to use Arch _(btw)_
- ðŸ“« Reach me at [me\@zakkbob.dev](mailto:me\@zakkbob.dev)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have an awesome github account [@zakkbob](https://github.zakkbob.dev) (you're on it right now)
- ðŸ’¥ Funner fact: I own [zakkbob.dev](https://zakkbob.dev), which may or may not someday feature a website

I also made a GPG key for some reason. So here's its fingerprint: <br>
```F5F0 C5CD 7E01 B582 DA9C BA07 7109 3420 23C3 40E3```

Also, feel free to add this to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMraxFV3Iyg8ODkdkOYDhOwBHH0CLQ0X+0U3tvkdSZ4Q```

Random stats nobody looks at <br>
